## Bash Script for Git Commit and Push

This bash script simplifies the process of committing and pushing changes to a remote Git repository. It is designed to streamline your workflow and ensure that you don't miss any critical steps during version control. Before using the script, ensure that you have Git installed and configured on your system.

### Usage:
1. Save this script in a file named `git_commit_push.sh`.
2. Make the script executable by running `chmod +x git_commit_push.sh`.
3. Execute the script with a commit message as an argument:


### Script Workflow:
1. The script checks if you have provided a commit message as an argument. If no message is provided, it will display an error message and terminate.
2. If a commit message is provided, the script stages all changes in the current directory using `git add .`.
3. It then commits the changes with the provided message using `git commit -m`.
4. Finally, the script pushes the changes to the remote repository using `git push`.

### Note:
- Ensure you are in the correct Git repository directory before running the script.
- Make sure to pull any remote changes before pushing to avoid conflicts.

### Disclaimer:
This script is provided as-is and may not cover all possible use cases. Use it at your own risk. It is always recommended to review the script and understand its functionality before executing it.

Feel free to modify and improve the script to suit your specific requirements. Happy version controlling!
